For this web app, I wanted an idea that could easily follow the requirements for full CRUD, but also had a real purpose and addressed a topic of importance or interest. 'Just the Tip' came to be after a funny, yet enlightening, conversation with a close male friend, of which I go into greater detail on the main index.ejs file. Through tasteful adult humor, the app can address serious issues, yet maintain an approachability that people can trust.
